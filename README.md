# ðŸŒŽðŸš¢ Global Shipping Lanes

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/470472856.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/470472856)

This geospatial datasets contains global shipping lanes / routes. The shipping routes are georeferenced from the famous [Map of The Worls Oceans, October 2012](https://www.loc.gov/item/2013591571/) created by the [Central Intelligence Agency](https://www.cia.gov/), along with changes that fix problems with the original map. This map will evolve as further edits cause it to deviate from the original CIA map.

## Features

The polyline feature class contains an attribute named "Type", which is one of three values:

1. Major

3. Minor

These designate importance of shipping lanes, which does corrospond somewhat with traffic.
